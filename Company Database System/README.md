<h2> Introduction </h2>
  
Simple Company Database System done in MYSQL Workbench and Java for CS331 Database System class's Final Project.

<h3> Skills: </h3>
<p> -Simulate how traditional applications use Java to access and use data from a database <br>
  -Practice using JDBC API to connect to a database <br>
  -Create a complete Java application that can access MySQL Database and retrieve some queries <br>
  -Practice OO skill in implementing multiple tasks in a project <br> </p>


<h4> Setting up the Database: </h4>

Requires:
<p>-MySQL Server, host it through a VM <br>
-two .jar files in src folder (mysql-connector-java and protobuf)<br></p>

How to set up:
<p>
1) Run project2_script-2.sql to generate Cleaning Shop's Schema <br>
2) Run Insert statements-1.sql to insert dummy data into database table
</p>

To view EER Model generated: <br>
<p>
1) Open EER Model.png or run Project2-2.mwb
</p>

<h4> Querying the Database: </h4>

Requires: Java and IDE

How to run menu to query database:
<p>
1) Run Task4.java, this is the .main file (named after our assigned Task as a group of two students)

<h4> 3 out of 4 Menu Options are implemented: </h4>
